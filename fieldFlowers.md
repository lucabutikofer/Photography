With this on-going series I focus on ruderal vegetation: plants that grow on disturbed land. These communities of species naturally occur on ephemeral environments. They develop quickly after some sort of disturbance—maybe the falling of a large tree—but are destined to be rapidly supplanted by other, more persistent forms of vegetation.

The fleeting nature of these communities is similar to that of a sunset. Given the right conditions, for a few minutes the sky pours sublime colours over everything in sight.

To evoke a sense of impermanence, these images are all taken at sunset.
