Nature is often portrayed in its most impressive guise: spectacular landscapes, majestic animals, delicate flowers. Authors point out rare species, exceptional properties, unusual forms and colours, as if to say that those are the most valuable among all things natural.

Here is a tribute to nature’s humblest. Species you wouldn’t notice. Plants that barely can be separated from their backgrounds. Common things, themselves the background of nature’s most celebrated. 

In the Isha Upanishad it is said that “what has come out of the whole is also whole”. “Even a fraction of the Supreme Being is whole and complete by itself.” (*C. Rajagopalachari, Ramayana, 1989*)
