To me, the word “mediterranean” evokes a large set of meanings. A sea, enclosed by land; a rare and peculiar biome; the nations along its shorelines; the rich history of its populations; and the diversity of cultures, which yet remain markedly mediterranean. The fertility of this land eventually gave birth to western culture, and so it spreads its influence far past its geographic boundaries.

Portraying the mediterranean systematically would be nearly impossible. So, here I leverage on details and ordinary scenes to evoke a general feeling for this multifaceted region.
