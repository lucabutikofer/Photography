As a research ecologist, I am often brought to experience the natural world from unusual perspectives. A pretty flower near the beach becomes an invasive, alien species threatening the balance of the local dune system; a piece of soil is a complex ecosystem with ramifications reaching out to food production and climate change.

I began using photography as a means of rigorous documentation, whereby scientific concepts were to be represented as clearly and realistically as possible. This attitude gradually relaxed, progressively allowing the subjective view to mix in with the original subject matter – a discourse was born between reason and intuition. My work draws from this conversation, is triggered by natural elements, and typically results in slightly puzzling abstractions.
